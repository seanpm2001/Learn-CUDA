* I decided to make CUDA the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-CUDA) as CUDA is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the CUDA programming language. It only makes sense to CUDA the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
